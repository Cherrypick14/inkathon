## Self-hosting

The inkathon boilerplate treats self-hosting as a first-class citizen. It comes with a state-of-the-art Dockerfile configuration for Next.js self-hosting. There's even a self-hosted version of inkathon.xyz running at [https://inkathon.scio.xyz](https://inkathon.scio.xyz).

Build and run the Docker image locally:

```bash
# Execute from the root directory
docker build -t inkathon .
docker run -p 3000:3000 inkathon
```

## Vercel

The boilerplate is ready to be deployed to Vercel using the `vercel.json` configuration file at the root of the project.

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import your project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Configure environment variables (if needed)
4. Deploy with one click

The `vercel.json` configuration handles all necessary settings for the monorepo structure.

### Alternatives
