# Hosting

Deploy your inkathon application to production with various hosting options.

## Self-hosting

The inkathon boilerplate treats self-hosting as a first-class citizen. It comes with a state-of-the-art Dockerfile configuration for Next.js self-hosting. There's even a self-hosted version of inkathon.xyz running at [https://inkathon.scio.xyz](https://inkathon.scio.xyz).

### Building and Running with Docker

Build and run the Docker image locally:

```bash
# Execute from the root directory
docker build -t inkathon .
docker run -p 3000:3000 inkathon
```

### Production Deployment

The Docker image is optimized for production use with:
- Multi-stage builds for minimal image size
- Standalone Next.js output mode
- Security best practices
- Environment variable support

## Vercel

The boilerplate is ready to be deployed to Vercel using the `vercel.json` configuration file at the root of the project.

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import your project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Configure environment variables if needed
4. Deploy with one click

The `vercel.json` configuration handles all necessary settings for the monorepo structure.

## Environment Variables

For both hosting options, make sure to configure the necessary environment variables:

- Chain configuration
- RPC endpoints
- Any API keys or secrets your application requires

Refer to the `.env.example` files in the project for a complete list of required variables.
