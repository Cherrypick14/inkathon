## The Project

The inkathon boilerplate is almost as old as ink! itself. With 200+ stars, 25k+ `useInkathon` downloads, and 250+ public dependent repositories speaking for themselves. Its goal is to lower the entry barrier for all kinds of developers by reducing the initial setup cost by dozens of hours.

We've also initiated the most active [ink! Telegram group](https://t.me/inkathon) and hosted a bunch of developer workshops at hackathons and conferences.

## The Boilerplate

This project offers a complete setup for developing full-stack dApps on Polkadot with ink! smart contracts and Next.js and now shines in new glory with full ink! v6 support. Powered by Papi, ReactiveDOT, Pop CLI, and more.

### New Features in v6

- **Full ink! v6 support** with PolkaVM compatibility
- **Type-safe contract interactions** via PAPI
- **Modern stack**: Bun, Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Improved DX**: Better build scripts & deployment automation
- **Production-ready**: Docker support, self-hosting optimized
- **New `create-inkathon-app` CLI** for setting up the boilerplate in seconds

## Changelog
