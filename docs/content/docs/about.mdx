## The Project

The inkathon boilerplate is almost as old as ink! itself. With over 200 stars, more than 250 public projects depending on it, and the most active [ink! Telegram group](https://t.me/inkathon).

It offers a complete setup for developing full-stack dApps on Polkadot with ink! smart contracts and Next.js and now shines in new glory with full ink! v6 support. Powered by Papi, ReactiveDOT, Pop CLI, and more.

## New Features in v6

The boilerplate has been completely rebuilt with:

- **Full ink! v6 support** with PolkaVM compatibility
- **Type-safe contract interactions** via PAPI
- **Modern stack**: Bun, Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Improved DX**: Better build scripts & deployment automation
- **Production-ready**: Docker support, self-hosting optimized
- **New `create-inkathon-app` CLI** for setting up the boilerplate in seconds
